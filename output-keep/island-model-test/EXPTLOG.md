# Purpose

To plot results of an evolutionary run with island model enabled, such as that run by the `do-island-test` script

4 islands all running sga alg, with migration period 10,
150 trials per config, 30 configs per gen, 50 gens

# Code

Let's assume we've run the `do-island-test` script, which looks like this:

```
./run-release -c config-files/evolve-entrance-positions-4-rows-with-energetics.cfg --num-bees 100 --num-trials-per-config 150 --num-configs-per-gen 30 --num-generations=50 --num-islands 4 --migration-period 10 --migration-num-select 3 --migration-num-replace 3 | tee out-island-test.txt
```

From the output of the above, make a CSV file containing generation number and EMD score for each evaluation:

```
gawk '/INFO: Island/ {print $3","$5","$16}' out-island-test.txt > out-island-test.csv
```

Now plot this data:

```
./tools/plot_emd_scores_islands.py out-island-test.csv
```

and then save the plot via the GUI of the `plot_emd_scores.py` script, and rename it:

```
mv ~/Figure_1.png out-island-test.png
```
